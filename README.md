# ph

A helper for [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence) and [preservation](https://github.com/nix-community/preservation).

When you remove entries from your persistence configuration, those entries are
not automatically deleted from the persistence root. This tool helps you prune
unused entries from your persistence roots.
